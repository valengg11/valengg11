### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I am Valentina GÃ³mez Giraldo!

IÂ´m a creative and ingenious software developer, I decided to re-focus my professional career to the web development world, and couldn't be happier with my decision.

IÂ´m passionate about facing challenges, learning new things, and connecting with people who motivate me and inspire me to be better.

IÂ´m forward to improve my skills as a frontend developer and find a job where I can put into practice my knowledge, contribute to the creation of real-problem solutions, challenge myself every time, and work with a great team.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects to improve my skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about React and Redux.

Thanks for reading it all the way to the end!
